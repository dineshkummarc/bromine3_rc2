# Bromine #

Bromine is an open source QA tool that uses selenium RC as its testing engine.

It provides project management, OS/browser specification, test-case creation as
well as user management.

Its lofty aim is to be the open source alternative to commercial tools (such 
as HP Quality Center).

Bromine also substantially eases the process of creating, maintaining and 
running Selenium RC tests. The tests are created with the custom Selenium IDE
format and uploaded to Bromine. The test can then be run on test machines 
(we refer to them as nodes) which are configured in Bromine.

Bromine was built using CakePHP (see below for framework details).

## What is CakePHP? ##

CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known
design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller
and MVC. Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables
PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without
any loss to flexibility.
